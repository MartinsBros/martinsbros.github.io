  Change for Change is a fundraising initiative that Calvary Chapel Fort
  Lauderdale began in 2010. Their outdated branding was not successfully
  capturing the attention of quick moving foot traffic and was losing momentum
  each year. I saw this as an opportunity to reintroduce the initiative with a
  bold public-facing image. I developed a new brand identity that leveraged the
  color yellow and I also created posters and banners that combined photography
  and copy in a way that would encourage action at even the lowest level, “Every
  penny counts”. The campaign was successful and the branding was widely
  appreciated among the community.
